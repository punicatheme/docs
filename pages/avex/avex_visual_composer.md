## Overview

In Avex, we added Visual Composer support. To activate the VC plugin following theme installation, go to Appearance > Install Plugins section, install it, and activate it. The plugin will then be ready to use.

Plugin installation following theme activation is available in the same section where the default WordPress editor is visible. In the create/edit page above the WordPress editor you will see two large, blue buttons called Backend Editor and Frontend Editor. These are exactly what you need to build content within Visual Composer.

To explore the capabilities of Visual Composer, we recommend you study the documentation and watch the video below:
