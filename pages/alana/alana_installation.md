## Installation

You can either choose to upload the theme to your server via ftp (only upload the unzipped folder "alana" into the folder **wp-content/themes/** ) or via WordPress upload function. To use the upload function of the WordPress admin panel make sure to ONLY upload the "alana.zip" file and not the whole archive file that you received.
